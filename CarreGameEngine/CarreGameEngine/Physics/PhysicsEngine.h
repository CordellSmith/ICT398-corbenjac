* @class PhysicsEngine
* @brief Physics engine that handles all object collisions and physics based movement
* @author Jack Matters
*
* @date 29/04/2018
* @version 1.0	Initial start. Took ideas from a previous physics engine I worked on that used ReactPhysics3D. Also used HelloWorld example as a guide.
*				Managed to get 2 spheres (currently shown as floor planes) to collide off each other and a floor.
*
* @date 05/04/2018
* @version 1.1	Altered code to draw a square dynamic rigid body instead of a sphere for testing purposes. Started work on camera collision. 
*
* @date 06/04/2018
* @version 1.2  Tidied up camera (player object) code. Force is now applied in direction camera was moved, calculations are done, then camera is moved to updated
*				position. Still needs some work, but will do for now.
*
* @date 18/04/2018
* @version 1.3	Big gap between versions due to other units requirements. Set up functions for initializing all object rigid bodies. Will need changing.
*
* @date 19/04/2018
* @version 1.4	Added testing for heightfield terrain shape. Got it loading and working, but without a visual terrain it is not possible to see if it is
*				working correctly or not. Have commented it out until I am able to keep working on it. Also added some more doxygen comments.
*
* @date 20/04/2018
* @version 1.5	Did some research and found out that objects become inactive after a set time of inactivity. Created new function to ensure all objects are always active.
*				This fixed the camera getting stuck, as well as other objects getting stuck in the air.
*
* @date 31/05/2018
* @version 2.0	Final version for submission.
